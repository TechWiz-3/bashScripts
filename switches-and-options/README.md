# Switches/options

[`hello.bash`](./hello.bash)  
Learning about script options from [here](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/arguments-options-bash-scripts) while working on some scripts in my automation repo.

[`get_time.bash`](./get_time.bash)  
Simple script using a much better (to me) way of managing switches and options inspired (once again) by the amazing [archey osx project](https://github.com/obihann/archey-osx/blob/master/bin/archey)
